# 📁 Appendix-A: Celestial Alignment Simulation (2500 BCE vs. 4400 BCE)

This appendix provides a reproducible Python-based analysis comparing the azimuthal alignment of seven Giza structures with the heliacal rising position of Alnitak (ζ Orionis) at two different epochs: 2500 BCE and 4400 BCE.

## 📄 Files Included

| Filename           | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `Appendix-A.docx`  | Full appendix text describing the astronomical alignment methodology and results. |
| `Appendix-A.pdf`   | PDF version of the appendix for easier viewing. |
| `Appendix_A.py`    | Python script to compute azimuthal deviation (ΔAz) and S-values for each structure. |

## 📌 Method Summary

- The script calculates:
  - The azimuthal difference between each structure and Alnitak for both 2500 BCE and 4400 BCE.
  - The S-value, representing 2D angular deviation in unit vector space.
- The results are output as a comparative table.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - `numpy` and `pandas` libraries (install via `pip install numpy pandas`)

2. **Execution**:
   ```bash
   python Appendix_A.py
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The script prints a table showing:
   - Each structure's azimuth.
   - ΔAz and S-values for 2500 BCE and 4400 BCE.
   - Example output format:
     ```
     Structure         Structure Azimuth (°)  Azimuth (2500 BCE)  ΔAz (2500 BCE)  S (2500 BCE)  Azimuth (4400 BCE)  ΔAz (4400 BCE)  S (4400 BCE)
     Khufu                        90.90000               89.30000          1.60000        0.02808             90.90000          0.00000        0.00000
     ...
     ```

## 🧭 Interpretation

- Lower S-values indicate closer alignment.
- Structures exhibit significantly lower S-values relative to Alnitak at **4400 BCE**, supporting the hypothesis of a **pre-dynastic origin** for the celestial planning at Giza.
